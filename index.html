        <h5>Hi there! Welcome to my personal portfolio! I have to admit it's always intimidating making a website about yourself but it's so you can get to know me a little better. Anyways I really hope you enjoy this small, simple site about me and if you want to connect with me more, click the link above, "Get In Touch"</h5>

            <img src="images/specna-arms-ck-UftftEGs-unsplash.jpg" alt="Soldier aiming weapon down range" width="70%" class="pt-5 pb-3">
            <p class="text-center">I joined the Army as an 11B (Infantryman) in 2021 and trained in Fort Benning, Georgia for 6 months. I've always wanted to serve my country ever since I was a little kid. I plan to do 20 years in the service and become a Green Beret in the next few years!</p>

            <img src="images/dhiva-krishna-X16zXcbxU4U-unsplash.jpg" alt="People parachuting down to earth" width="70%" class="pt-5 pb-3">
            <p class="text-white text-center">I am an absolute gearhead. Every car I have ever owned, I've worked on with my own two hands. The challenge of trying to fixing issues on your own car and the satisfaction of actually completing those challenges is exhilirating. I can definitely thank my older brother and the fast and furious franchise for that.</p>

            <p class="text-center">My biggest hobby and passion is IT and Technology, with a particular focus on programming with Python. I am currently enrolled in Coding Temple's Software Engineering bootcamp. I can't wait to finish the program as it will help me secure a great job, which in turn will help me in all aspects of my life. I really can't wait for that day to come!</p>
