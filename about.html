            <p class="text-center">I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on a Sunday afternoon on the 6th of October in 1996. Honestly, my childhood was great and filled with many good memories. Looking back, I never really thought 26 years could go by so fast but I'd say overall its been a great journey.</p>

            <p class="text-white text-center">In all those years, athletics has always been a big part of it, even when I was only a child. From playing football and running track in school to working out more in my later years, I've always been constantly doing something active. It's definitely help with the added stressors of getting older.</p>

            <p class="text-center">For example, with a lot of other areas in my life, I struggled to stay motivated or focused on what I was doing. I never understood why but it became very frustrating especially in school. Only within the last year and a half did I find out the root issue, ADHD. It wasn't a suprise to hear the diagnose from the doctor and honestly everything made a lot more sense why I am the way I am.</p>

        <p class="container text-white text-center pt-5 mt-5">To wrap this short story up, I am currently working to become the best version of myself and prove to everyone that even with my newly found diagnose, I can still kick butt in whatever challenge I try to face and ultimately win it. Which is why I enrolled in Coding Temple!</p>
